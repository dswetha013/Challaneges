Chanlenge 3:

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a


Ans :

Following script will return the value of the class value, based on the input key.


//function defination which takes 2 inputs - object and key
def get_value(obj, key)
    cnt = key.count(':') // if key like a1:a2:a3
    //for n in range(0, cnt):
    if (cnt ==0)
      value = obj.x
    else if (cnt == 1)
      value = obj.a2.x
    else if (cnt == 2)
      value = obj.a2.a3.x
    return value;

//nested class

class a1:
     x = 1
     class a2:
            x = 2
            class a3:
                 x = 4


//creating a object
obj = a1()

//following function will retun the value based on the input key
result = get_value(obj, "x:y:z")
print (result)
